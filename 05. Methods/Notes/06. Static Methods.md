# Static Methods:

- A class can contain two types of methods, that is Instance Methods and Static Methods. 
- Instance methods are the non-static methods which are not declared with the static modifier.
- If you use the static modifier while creating the method it is called a 'static' method, but if you don't use a static modifier it is called an 'instance' method (also called a non-static method).
- By default instance methods. 

```csharp
// public is an accessModifier, static is the modifier of the method, and void is the return type. 
public static void someMethod() 
{

}

```

**Whenever you want to manipulate the instance fields you should go for the instance method, but whenever you want to manipulate the static field, then you should create a static method.**


```csharp
    public static int TotalNoProducts;

   //static method: Set method TotalNoOfProducts
    public static void SetTotalNoOfProducts(int value)
    {
        TotalNoProducts = value;
    }

    //static method: Get method TotalNoOfProducts
    public static void GetTotalNoOfProducts()
    {
        return TotalNoProducts;
    }
```

The instance fields and instance methods are always associated to Objects, but the static fields and static methods are not binded to Objects, they are independent of Objects or common to ALL objects. 

```csharp
        //create objects
        product1 = new Product();
        Product.SetTotalNoOfProducts(Product.GetTotalNoOfProducts() + 1);//1
        //Product.TotalNoProducts++;//1
        product2 = new Product();
        Product.SetTotalNoOfProducts(Product.GetTotalNoOfProducts() + 2);//2
        //Product.TotalNoProducts++;//2
        product3 = new Product();
        Product.SetTotalNoOfProducts(Product.GetTotalNoOfProducts() + 3);//3
        //Product.TotalNoProducts++;//3
```
So overall we are not accessing the static field directly, we accessing the same indirectly through the static methods. This is the preferred way of programming as per the abstraction.

- The intention of the instance method is always to manipulate the isntance fields.
- The intention of the static method is to manipulate the static fields. 
- Instance methods are accessible through object only (through reference variable), so you must call the object in order to access the instance method. Practically you will store the object reference in a reference variable, so through the reference variable the instance methods can be called. 
- Whenever you get a null reference exception it means that you are trying to access an instance field or instance method through a reference variable and the current value of that reference variable is null.
