# Object Reference as Arguments

Just like you pass a return value as argument to a method, you can also pass reference variables as arguments to the method. 

Suppose there is a static methods that wants to manipulate two or more objects. So he static method should receive those objects in the form of reference variables. At that time you can pass the reference variable as argument, and issue the reference variable as parameter.

- if you pass "reference variable" as argument, the reference (address) of object will be passed to the method.
- the parameter's data type will be the class name.
- if you make any changes to object in the method, the same will be affected automatically in the caller method, as you are accessing the same object.

- we can access any property or field through the parameters product1, product2, etc. - In this way we have shifted the logic of calculation of totalWuanity form the main method into the class itself. 

- So overall the point to understand here is we are passing the refence variable as argument to the method, and the same reference of the same object is being issued by a parameter inside the method, so at that time both parameters and reference variables refer tot he same object. 
- You can do the same in a static or instance method.
- So we were able to implement encapsulation and abstraction.
