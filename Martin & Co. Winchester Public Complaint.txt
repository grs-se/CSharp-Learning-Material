Martin & Co. Winchester housed me beneath well-known violent domestic abusers and convicted drug users. My safety was put at risk. Having reported these problems several times to the director, they didn't help me at all. Also, I was subject to a year of hell living in the flat beneath those people. 
I issued a 10 page complaint letter to Martin & Co. Winchester, was told that I would receive a reply, but did not receive one.
