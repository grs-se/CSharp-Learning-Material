## Recap
**Fields**
Variables that are declared in the class; stored in the objects.

Isolated for each object.
Access Modifiers of Fields
Access Modifier (a.k.a. "Access Specifier" or "Visibility Modifier) specifies the accessibility of fields, where the fields can be accessible; they provide security for the fields.

**Key Points to Remember**

Fields are variables that are declared in the class; but stored in objects.

Access modifiers of fields: private, protected, private protected, internal, protected internal, public

Modifiers of fields: static, const, readonly

Instance fields are individual for each object; Static fields are common (one-time) for all objects.

Constants must be initialized along with declaration; Readonly fields must be initialized either 'along with declaration' or in 'instance constructor'.
